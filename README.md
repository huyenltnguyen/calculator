# Build a JavaScript Calculator

**Objective:** Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/#) app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/
#### User story:
  1. I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
  2. I can clear the input field with a clear button.
  3. I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
